        <p>1. I know this is not that amazing but coding is suprisingly very hard</p>
        <p>2. Nothing ever goes right, there are so many, many bugs in this one notes section alone. I eventually gave up trying to fix it.</p>
        <p>3. Why is the text so big? Why is it all in bold?</p>
        <p>4. I'm hoping it all went well since you're meant to click on a link and see all of this.</p>
        <p>5. I wanted to make the song play automatically but God said no.</p>
        <p>6. You might be wondering why did i make this? Well, remember last year when i got you a toblerone? Yeah that was a really shit gift, like why? why did i do that? i thought i'd give you something more thoughful this year.</p>
        <p>7. "Kyaw, why did you even get me a christmas present?" If you're wondering that then well...it's because i like you.</p>
        <p>8. "Now i have to get you something" Nope, you don't. Cause all i want for christmas is youuuuu!!! - Mariah Carey. God i'm bad at singing.</p>
        <p>9. As you've noticed by now, i did not get you a card. Hopefully i have kept this secret well.</p>
	<p>10. I have essentially made majority of this in one day. I spent a good few hours on it and i hope you like it.</p>
	<p>11. I can edit this whenever i want and it will change which is cool because as im typing (13/12/19) the website is live. Oh yeah, dont let others click on it, anybody can access it. I don't know how to restrict access yet.</p>
	<p>12. Wow thats a lot of notes, i should probably stop. Well that's it for now.</p>
	<p>13. (17/12/19) I made so many changes today. I decorated the website to make it look better. I might even be able to fix this notes page. I also added a pictures section. I hope you like it.</p>
        <p>14. I have mostly fixed the notes section. I am sadly going to have to call it a day and stop.</p>
	<p>15. (18/12/19) 7 days left till christmas. I did some testing today but nothing new. I hope you like the final look banANNA.</p>
