        <p>1. I know this is not that amazing but coding is suprisingly very hard</p>
        <p>2. Nothing ever goes right, there are so many, many bugs in this one notes section alone.I eventually gave up trying to fix it.</p>
        <p>3. Why is the text so big? Why is it all in bold?</p>
        <p>4. I'm hoping it all went well since you're meant to click on a link and see all of this.</p>
        <p>5. I wanted to make the song play automatically but God said no.</p>
        <p>6. You might be wondering why did i make this? Well, remember last year when i got you a toblerone? Yeah that was a really shit gift, like why? why did i do that? i thought i'd give something more thoughful this year.</p>
        <p>7. "Kyaw, why did you even get me a christmas present?" If you're wondering that then well...it's because i like you.</p>
        <p>8. "Now i have to get you something" Nope, you don't. Cause all i want for christmas is youuuuu!!! - Mariah Carey</p>
        <p>9. As you've noticed by now, i did not get you a card. Hopefully i have kept this secret well.</p>
