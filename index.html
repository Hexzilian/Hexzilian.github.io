Merry Christmas Anna!<br>
I hope you have a great christmas<br>
I didn't just want to get you something cheap<br>
so i made you a digital card. Coding is not easy.<br>
<br>
I dont really know how this year went for you since i wasn't<br>
always around at the beginning of the year. However, i hope<br>
that 2020 is an awesome year for you. And i hope i get to continue knowing<br>
you even in the distant future (i probably could word this better).<br>
<br>
Remember, if you need anything, i'm always here.<br>
I also just want you to know that i love you and am<br>
genuinly glad i met you. So if you ever feel down<br>
and need to turn your frown the other way around<br>
remember, you're not alone. You've got me.
